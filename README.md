## 🌐 WebGL Demo

See a live WebGL build deployed using this CI/CD pipeline:

➡️ [**Play the Demo**](https://avalin.github.io/Unity-CI-Templates/)

> Deployed via GitHub Pages using the `gh-pages` deploy target.


## 🧠 Getting Started

1. Clone this repo or copy the `CICD_Workflows` workflows into your Unity project's .github/workflows folder.
2. Set your required secrets.
3. Dispatch the `ci-cd-dispatcher.yml` workflow or create a Git tag using semver to trigger the pipeline!<br/>
1️⃣ Make sure your Unity project is in a GitHub repository<br/>
2️⃣ Copy the required GitHub Actions workflows from the CICD_Workflows folder<br/>
2️⃣ Add it to your repository at path: .github → workflows (create folders if they're missing)<br/>
3️⃣ Configure the needed secrets and variables (optional)<br/>
4️⃣ Review the wiki pages here to understand the versioning, deployment, and customization options<br/>
> ⚠️ Currently tested deploy targets: `gh-pages` (WebGL only). Others are implemented but not yet fully verified. Contributions welcome!

## ⚠ Current Limitations

While the pipeline is production-ready and modular, some deploy integrations are still marked as **experimental**:

- 🚧 **Deploy targets like Steam, TestFlight, App Center**  
  These are implemented but have not yet been fully validated in live release pipelines.

- 🔗 **External platforms may require manual setup**  
  Some targets (like itch.io, Firebase, S3) require correctly configured secrets and accounts - be sure to test deploy flows in a safe sandbox environment before pushing to production.

- 🧪 **Unity version compatibility**  
  Currently optimized for Unity 2022.3+, tested with Unity 6 too, but older versions may work with minor adjustments.

> **Contributions and testing feedback are welcome!**  
> If you successfully validate additional targets or add new ones, please consider opening a PR to improve support for the community.
